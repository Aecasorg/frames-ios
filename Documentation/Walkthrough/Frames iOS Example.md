# Frames iOS example

To create the card token, you will need to instantiate `CheckoutAPIClient` with
your public key. If you don't have one already, [request an account](https://www.checkout.com/contact-sales).

```swift
    let checkoutAPIClient = CheckoutAPIClient(publicKey: "pk_test_03728582-062b-419c-91b5-63ac2a481e07",
                                              environment: .sandbox)
```

You can replace `pk_test_03728582-062b-419c-91b5-63ac2a481e07` with your own public key.

```swift
  let cardViewController = CardViewController(cardHolderNameState: .hidden, billingDetailsState: .normal)
```

Instantiate a `CardViewController`, which will load a form to enter card details in. The constructor takes two
arguments: `cardHolderNameState` and `billingDetailsState`. You can specify whether you want to include those fields
in the form.

```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // set the card view controller delegate
        cardViewController.delegate = self
        // replace the bar button by Pay
        cardViewController.rightBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Pay", style: .done, target: nil, action: nil)
        // specified which schemes are allowed
        cardViewController.availableSchemes = [.visa, .mastercard]
    }
```

In the example, we replaced the _Done_ button with _Pay_. We also specified which schemes are allowed.
By default, all schemes are allowed (see `CardScheme`). You can also used the `CheckoutAPIClient` to
get the list of card providers that you set in the Hub.

The controller must conform to the delegate `CardViewControllerDelegate`.

```swift
class MainViewController: UIViewController, CardViewControllerDelegate {
```

The delegate contains one method called `onTapDone`. This method is executed when the user taps
on the _Done_ button to validate the card information.

> Note that in the example, the _Done_ button has been renamed _Pay_.

```swift
    func onTapDone(controller: CardViewController, card: CkoCardTokenRequest) {
        controller.navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
        checkoutAPIClient.createCardToken(card: card, successHandler: { cardToken in
            self.showAlert(with: cardToken.id)
        }, errorHandler: { error in
            print(error)
        })
    }
```

The `onTapDone` method takes the card token request generated by the user as an argument.

You can use this card token request to generate a card token via our API.
In the code above, `checkoutAPIClient.createCardToken` uses the card token request, which will make a call to the API to generate a card token. You should define a success and error handler to react to the API response.
